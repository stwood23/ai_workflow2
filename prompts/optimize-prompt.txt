 I need assistance refining a raw, basic prompt into a highly effective and detailed prompt that maximizes clarity and focus, ensuring the final prompt is capable of achieving a specific end goal.
 Please analyze the raw input provided, expand on it with structured sections, include potential sub-questions or clarifications where necessary, and suggest any additional details that might enhance the output quality.
 The final result should be concise yet thorough, using clear language and organized sections that demonstrate expert-level understanding of the subject matter.
 Additionally, consider any relevant contrarian perspectives or innovative approaches, and recommend only the highest-quality practices or products as part of the response.

Do NOT attempt to execute the prompt or ask for values for placeholders like {{topic}}.
CRITICAL: Identify and preserve EXACTLY any text enclosed in double curly braces, like {{placeholder_name}}. Do NOT modify or remove these placeholders. The output MUST contain the original placeholders unchanged.
Output ONLY the refined prompt template text. Do not include explanations, introductions, or any conversational text.
